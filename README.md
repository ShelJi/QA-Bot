# QA-Bot

`pip install transformers torch streamlit`

## ü§ñ 1. Transformers

**Library:** Part of Hugging Face.

**Used for:** Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks like:

- Text classification
- Question answering
- Translation
- Text generation (like ChatGPT!)

```python
from transformers import pipeline

qa = pipeline("question-answering")
qa(question="What is the capital of France?", context="France's capital is Paris.")
# Output: {'answer': 'Paris'}
```

## üî• 2. Torch (PyTorch)

**Library:** Developed by Facebook AI.

**Used for:** Deep learning and building neural networks.

**Alternative to:** TensorFlow.

Works behind the scenes in many models from Hugging Face.

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0])
y = x * 2
print(y)  # tensor([2., 4.])
```

## üåê 3. Streamlit

**Library:** For building interactive web apps in Python.

**Great for:** AI demos, dashboards, data science tools.

```python
import streamlit as st

st.title("Hello Streamlit!")
name = st.text_input("Enter your name")
st.write("Hello", name)
```
